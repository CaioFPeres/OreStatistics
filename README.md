OreStatistics
This is a plugin for Paper Minecraft Server to check ore distribution. Works similarly with my SkyChunks plugin, with same complexity. SkyChunks readme is even more complete than this one.

UPDATE YOUR JAVA TO 16 TO USE PAPER SERVER 1.17. This plugin was also compiled with java 16.

Plugin is at: \out\artifacts\OreStatistics_jar\OreStatistics.jar\

Wait until your cpu load go down, so you can enter the game.

This plugin will delete everything from new chunks except ore blocks, so remember to use it with a new world (or with a backup/throw away). This plugin is not intended for gameplay, only to check ore distribution.

The deletion isn't necessary, its done only for graphical purposes. It wouldn't be faster anyway (i think).

Commands:

/ore

To check the three highest concentration heights found for an ore, just type /ore. Example: /diamond .

/ore

To check the number of ores found at an specific height, you can type /ore . Example: /diamond 5 .

You can also reset the counters using /reload confirm. This will reload all plugins tho, not only this one, this command is from Paper itself.
